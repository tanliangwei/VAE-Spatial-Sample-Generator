Description

Model 2_1:

Basic VAE Model

intermediate_dim_1 = 50
intermediate_dim_2 = 50
latent_dim = 4

What's new:

Continuous Data - 
	review_count - handle by outputting log of the review count and not using any activation.
	latitude and longitude, normalised with sigmoid
Categorical Data - One hot encoding, softmax
Binary Data - Activation Sigmoid

Selectivity - we remove predicates which will result in 0 samples in actual dataset

Conclusion

Poor results - Still poor results unable to predict well 
	- very poor results for review_count predictions
Better review count but still worse than model 6
Very bad spatial performance even though samples are within range. Did not manage to get any samples in certain query of rare subpopulations.
