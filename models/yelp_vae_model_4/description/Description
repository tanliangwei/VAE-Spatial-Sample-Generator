Description

Model 4:

Basic VAE Model

Changed dimensions of weights
intermediate_dim_1 = 50
intermediate_dim_2 = 50
latent_dim = 4
Reverted back to model 2's parameters since they perform better.

Continuous Data - 
	reviews - will now try a Poisson distribution since it might fit the underlying data better
	latitude and longitude - normalise to 360 them before training and will likely use the Gaussian distribution afterwards. (Coordinate + 180) /360
Categorical Data - One hot encoding, softmax
Binary Data - Activation Sigmoid


Conclusion
