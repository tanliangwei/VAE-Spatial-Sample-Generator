Description

Model 13:

Basic VAE Model

Changed dimensions of weights
intermediate_dim_1 = 50 
intermediate_dim_2 = 50
latent_dim = 4
Reverted to 50, 50 for intermediate layer weights since it gave better results in Model 2. 

Main change 
Used MAF normalising flows
Added permutations in the flows

Old
To use mixture models at the output layer for the coordinates.
Back to diggonal covariance
Will convert coordinates to mecator coordinates before attempting learning.



Others
reviews - will now try a Poisson distribution since it might fit the underlying data better
latitude and longitude - normalise using standard normalisation (having 0 mean and 1 variance) before training and will likely use the Gaussian distribution afterwards.
Categorical Data - One hot encoding, softmax
Binary Data - Activation Sigmoid


Conclusion
Good results with a smaller data size
