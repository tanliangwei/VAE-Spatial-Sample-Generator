Description

Model 5:

Basic VAE Model

Changed dimensions of weights
intermediate_dim_1 = 50 
intermediate_dim_2 = 50
latent_dim = 4
Reverted to 50, 50 for intermediate layer weights since it gave better results in Model 2. 


Main change - 
reviews - will now try a Poisson distribution since it might fit the underlying data better

Continuous Data - 
	reviews - will now try a Poisson distribution since it might fit the underlying data better
	latitude and longitude - normalise to 360 them before training and will likely use the Gaussian distribution afterwards. (Coordinate + 180) /360
Categorical Data - One hot encoding, softmax
Binary Data - Activation Sigmoid


Conclusion

Better results in general. Much better results. However, still not the best. Maybe can train longer.
