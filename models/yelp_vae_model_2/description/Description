Description

Model 2:

Basic VAE Model

intermediate_dim_1 = 50
intermediate_dim_2 = 50
latent_dim = 4

What's new:

Continuous Data - 
	review_count - handle using RELU
	latitude and longitude, normalised with sigmoid
Categorical Data - One hot encoding, softmax
Binary Data - Activation Sigmoid

Selectivity - we remove predicates which will result in 0 samples in actual dataset

Conclusion

Poor results - Still poor results unable to predict well 
	- very poor results for review_count predictions

Latitude and longitude exceeds -180/+180
Review_count might turn negative which does not make any sense
