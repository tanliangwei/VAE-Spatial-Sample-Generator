Description

Model 1:

Basic VAE Model

intermediate_dim_1 = 50
intermediate_dim_2 = 50
latent_dim = 4

Continuous Data - no activation or handling
Categorical Data - One hot encoding, softmax
Binary Data - Activation Sigmoid


Conclusion

Poor results - Average Error > 10%
Latitude and longitude exceeds -180/+180
Review_count might turn negative which does not make any sense

Problems:
Exploding loss, loss turned nan cause its too big, so I used sigmoid/tanh to ensure it stays within reasonable range.

stars not outputting .5s. it only outputs integers
