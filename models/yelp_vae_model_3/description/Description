Description

Model 3:

Basic VAE Model

Changed dimensions of weights
intermediate_dim_1 = 12
intermediate_dim_2 = 8
latent_dim = 4

Continuous Data - 
	reviews - rely
	latitude and longitude - sigmoid (normalised)
Categorical Data - One hot encoding, softmax
Binary Data - Activation Sigmoid


Conclusion

Poor results - 
	-Still very bad for review counts
