Description

Model 8:

Basic VAE Model

Changed dimensions of weights
intermediate_dim_1 = 50 
intermediate_dim_2 = 50
latent_dim = 4
Reverted to 50, 50 for intermediate layer weights since it gave better results in Model 2. 

Main Change
To use mixture models at the output layer for the coordinates.
Used a multi normal triangular covariance


Others
reviews - will now try a Poisson distribution since it might fit the underlying data better
latitude and longitude - normalise using standard normalisation (having 0 mean and 1 variance) before training and will likely use the Gaussian distribution afterwards.
Categorical Data - One hot encoding, softmax
Binary Data - Activation Sigmoid


Conclusion
Slightly worse off for normal predicates
Better for spatial predicates, at least no empty subpopulation
