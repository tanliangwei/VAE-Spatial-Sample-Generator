# VAE Spatial Sample Generator
This repository explores the possibility of using Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) to learn the statistical characteristics of a certain specified dataset and generate samples having similar characteristics. This work presents an interesting direction of research for applications involving Approximate Query Processing (AQP) .

## How to use this repository
This repository contains notebooks for training the proposed model, generating samples and performing testing. It is not yet intended for practical use. It contains 3 kinds of scripts. 

1. **Model Scripts** - Contains Model Architecture and facilitates model training.
2. **Sample Generating Scripts** - Generate samples using the model trained from **Model Scripts**
3. **Experiment Scripts** - Scripts for conducting experiments to evaluate model performance. Uses samples generated from **Sample Generating Scripts**.
